abstract = {In this paper we survey methods by which supersymmetry (or other new physics) could be observed in experiments at present and future accelerators. We review some of the motivation for supposing supersymmetry might be a symmetry of nature even though there is presently no evidence for it. We try to systematize the necessary new notation, and discuss in some detail how to calculate results, with considerable emphasis on pedagogical completeness. We summarize present limits on the existence of supersymmetric partners of ordinary particles, and show how to get improved quantitative limits if supersymmetric particles are not detected, so that eventually it is possible to be sure they are either detected or do not exist on the mass scale accessible to experiments.}

abstract = {Using a three-dimensional (3d) effective field theory and non-perturbative lattice simulations, we study the MSSM electroweak phase transition with two dynamical Higgs doublets. We first carry out a general analysis of spontaneous CP violation in 3d two Higgs doublet models, finding that this part of the parameter space is well separated from that corresponding to the physical MSSM. We then choose physical parameter values with explicit CP violation and a light right-handed stop, and determine the strength of the phase transition. We find a transition somewhat stronger than in 2-loop perturbation theory, leading to the conclusion that from the point of view of the non-equilibrium constraint, MSSM electroweak baryogenesis can be allowed even for a Higgs mass mH≈115 GeV. We also find that small values of the mass parameter mA (≲120 GeV), which would relax the experimental constraint on mH, do not weaken the transition noticeably for a light enough stop. Finally we determine the properties of the phase boundary.}

The SCT is constructed of 4088 silicon detector modules for a total of 6.3million channels. Each module is designed, constructed and tested to operate as a stand-alone unit, mechanically, electrically, optically and thermally. The modules are mounted into two types of structures: one barrel (4 cylinders) and two end-cap systems (9 disks on each). The current results from the successful operation of the SCT Detector at the LHC and its status after three years of operation will be presented. The operation of the detector including an overview of the main issues encountered is reported. The main emphasis is given to the tracking performance of the SCT and the data quality during the >2 years of data taking of proton–proton collision data at 7TeV (and short periods of heavy ion collisions). The SCT has been fully operational throughout all data taking periods, delivering high quality tracking data.}

abstract = {The high-luminosity phase of LHC operations (HL-LHC), will feature a large increase in simultaneous proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing up to 200, compared with a typical leveling target of 64 in Run 3. Such an increase will create a very challenging environment in which to perform charged particle trajectory reconstruction, a task crucial for the success of the ATLAS physics program, and will exceed the capabilities of the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID).  A new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) will replace the current ID in time for the start of the HL-LHC.  To ensure successful use of the ITk capabilities in Run 4 and beyond, the ATLAS tracking software has been successfully adapted to achieve state-of-the-art track reconstruction in challenging high-luminosity conditions with the ITk detector. This paper presents the expected tracking performance of the ATLAS ITk based on the latest available developments since the ITk technical design reports.}

ABSTRACT = {Metric learning aims to measure the similarity among samples while using an optimal distance metric for learning tasks. Metric learning methods, which generally use a linear projection, are limited in solving real-world problems demonstrating non-linear characteristics. Kernel approaches are utilized in metric learning to address this problem. In recent years, deep metric learning, which provides a better solution for nonlinear data through activation functions, has attracted researchers’ attention in many different areas. This article aims to reveal the importance of deep metric learning and the problems dealt with in this field in the light of recent studies. As far as the research conducted in this field are concerned, most existing studies that are inspired by Siamese and Triplet networks are commonly used to correlate among samples while using shared weights in deep metric learning. The success of these networks is based on their capacity to understand the similarity relationship among samples. Moreover, sampling strategy, appropriate distance metric, and the structure of the network are the challenging factors for researchers to improve the performance of the network model. This article is considered to be important, as it is the first comprehensive study in which these factors are systematically analyzed and evaluated as a whole and supported by comparing the quantitative results of the methods.},

	abstract = {An overview of deep metric learning methods is presented. Although they have appeared in recent years, these methods were compared only with their predecessors, with neural networks of outdated architectures used for representation learning (representations on which the metric is calculated). The described methods were compared on different datasets from several domains, using pre-trained neural networks comparable in performance to SotA (state of the art): ConvNeXt for images and DistilBERT for texts. Labeled datasets were used, divided into two parts (train and test) so that the classes did not overlap (i.e., for each class its objects are fully in train or fully in test). Such a large-scale honest comparison was made for the first time and led to unexpected conclusions, viz. some ``old''methods, for example, Tuplet Margin Loss, are superior in performance to their modern modifications and methods proposed in very recent works.},

	abstract = {The Exa.TrkX project has applied geometric learning concepts such as metric learning and graph neural networks to HEP particle tracking. Exa.TrkX's tracking pipeline groups detector measurements to form track candidates and filters them. The pipeline, originally developed using the TrackML dataset (a simulation of an LHC-inspired tracking detector), has been demonstrated on other detectors, including DUNE Liquid Argon TPC and CMS High-Granularity Calorimeter. This paper documents new developments needed to study the physics and computing performance of the Exa.TrkX pipeline on the full TrackML dataset, a first step towards validating the pipeline using ATLAS and CMS data. The pipeline achieves tracking efficiency and purity similar to production tracking algorithms. Crucially for future HEP applications, the pipeline benefits significantly from GPU acceleration, and its computational requirements scale close to linearly with the number of particles in the event.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and performance of a particle flow algorithm applied to 20.2 fb{\$}{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}of ATLAS data from 8 TeV proton--proton collisions in Run 1 of the LHC. The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in resolution and pile-up stability.},

abstract = {A novel technique to identify and split clusters created by multiple charged particles in the ATLAS pixel detector using a set of artificial neural networks is presented. Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.}

abstract = {An analytical calculation of the variance is performed, in some simple case, for standard least-squares estimators of track parameters (accounting for independent measurement errors only); comparison is made with optimal estimators (accounting also for scattering errors, correlated between one point and the following ones). A new method is proposed for optimal estimation: the points measured on the track are included backwards, one by one, in the fitting algorithm, and the scattering is handled locally at each step. The feasibility of the method is shown on real events, for which the geometrical resolution is improved. The algorithm is very flexible and allows fast programmation; moreover the computation time is merely proportional to the number of measured points, contrary to the other optimal estimators.}

The SPECint_base2000 (SI2K) unit of performance has been used by the major HEP experiments both in the Computing Technical Design Report for the LHC experiments and in the evaluation of the Computing Centres. At recent HEPiX[3] meetings several HEP sites have reported disagreements between actual machine performances and the scores reported by SPEC.

Our group performed a detailed comparison of Simulation and Reconstruction code performances from the four LHC experiments in order to find a successor to the SI2K benchmark. We analyzed the new benchmarks from SPEC CPU2006 suite, both integer and floating point, in order to find the best agreement with the HEP code behaviour, with particular attention paid to reproducing the actual environment of HEP farm i.e., each job running independently on each core, and matching compiler, optimization, percentage of integer and floating point operations, and ease of use.}

abstract = {Results from a wide range of searches targeting different experimental signatures with and without missing transverse momentum (ETmiss) are used to constrain a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with an additional pseudo-scalar mediating the interaction between ordinary and dark matter (2HDM+a). The analyses use up to 139 fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy s=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2015-2018. The results from three of the most sensitive searches are combined statistically. These searches target signatures with large ETmiss and a leptonically decaying Z boson; large ETmiss and a Higgs boson decaying to bottom quarks; and production of charged Higgs bosons in final states with top and bottom quarks, respectively. Constraints are derived for several common and new benchmark scenarios in the 2HDM+a.}

abstract = {Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.}
